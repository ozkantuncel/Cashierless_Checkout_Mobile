#  Cashierless Checkout Mobile

My Object-Oriented Programming requested a project by me. I decided this project. In my C# Windows Form desktop application, I implemented the payment section using a QR reader and [Firebase][15].

## Libraries Used

* [Navigation][4]: You can navigate between composables.
